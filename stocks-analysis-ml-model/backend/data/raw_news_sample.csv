2026-02-09,"World Defense Show 2026 reflects maturity, scale and global confidence, says Mansour Al-Babtain","As the World Defense Show (WDS) enters its third edition, the event has moved decisively from launch phase to global fixture. Speaking during World Defense Show 2026, Mansour Al-Babtain, Vice President for Commercial Partnerships and Liaison at the World Defense Show, reflects on the show’s growing international stature, its role in advancing Saudi Arabia’s defense localization agenda, and how WDS is positioning itself as a serious, integrated platform for long-term industrial and strategic collaboration. Q1: World Defense Show has quickly established itself on the global defense calendar. From your perspective, what defines this edition of WDS?This edition reflects maturity. World Defense Show is no longer introducing itself to the global defense community; it is operating as a fully established platform. What defines WDS 2026 is the scale of engagement and the seriousness of intent we are seeing across government, industry, and international delegations. Crucially, it remains the only global defense exhibition structured around five fully integrated domains: air, land, sea, space, and security.From the outset, the Show has been designed around integration — not only across these five domains, but across people, institutions, and industry. That is particularly visible this year in the depth of dialogue, the quality of participation, and the outcomes emerging throughout the week.Q2: Many global defense exhibitions focus on scale or spectacle. How does WDS distinguish itself in practical terms?WDS distinguishes itself through operational realism and structure. It is a purpose-built venue that allows companies and delegations to see capabilities operating in realistic conditions, including live air displays, land demonstrations, unmanned systems, and integrated content programs, all within a single environment.This year, that operational realism is further enhanced through four new dedicated zones: the Future Defense Lab, the Saudi Supply Chain Zone, the Unmanned Systems Zone, and the Naval Zone. Each provides a focused environment where specific capabilities can be demonstrated, assessed, and discussed in context.That matters because defense decision-making today is increasingly about systems working together, not standalone platforms. WDS moves the conversation beyond brochures and static displays into something tangible and credible.Q3: What does the level of international participation at WDS say about Saudi Arabia’s position in the global defense ecosystem today?It reflects confidence. International companies and delegations participate where they see long-term opportunity and seriousness of purpose. The breadth of participation at WDS — with exhibitors from more than 80 countries, spanning established defense primes, technology providers, SMEs, and innovators — signals that Saudi Arabia is viewed as a central and credible player in the global defense and security landscape.Importantly, this participation is not symbolic. It is structured around engagement, dialogue, and partnership exploration, which is what gives the Show its relevance beyond the exhibition halls.Q4: World Defense Show is closely aligned with Vision 2030. How does that alignment translate in practice during the Show?Vision 2030 is ultimately about building sustainable capability — economic, industrial, and human. WDS supports that by acting as a platform where those elements intersect.From an economic perspective, the Show contributes directly to GDP and employment. The previous edition generated approximately SAR 500 million in GDP impact and supported more than 4,600 jobs across event delivery, services, logistics, and the wider ecosystem. This year builds on that trajectory, with the Show now spanning 273,000 square meters across four fully sold-out exhibition halls, alongside significantly expanded participation and programming.At the same time, WDS creates visibility and access by connecting Saudi entities with international partners, investors, and technology providers within a structured and transparent environment.Q5: Localization is a national priority, led by the General Authority for Military Industries. What role does WDS play in supporting that agenda?WDS does not define localization policy; that role sits clearly with the General Authority for Military Industries. What WDS does is provide the platform that enables those conversations to happen efficiently and credibly.The Kingdom has made substantial progress, reaching 24.89% defense localization by the end of 2024, demonstrating clear momentum toward the Vision 2030 target of 50%. WDS supports that trajectory by bringing together the entire ecosystem — Saudi industry, international companies, supply-chain players, technology providers, investors, and decision-makers — in one place.Localization outcomes emerge from these interactions, but the value of WDS lies in convening the right stakeholders and creating visibility around opportunity at scale.Q6: The Saudi Supply Chain Zone has been a visible feature at this year’s Show. Why is this important from WDS’s perspective?The Saudi Supply Chain Zone reflects the practical side of engagement. With 57 Saudi companies participating, it creates a dedicated environment where Saudi SMEs and industrial players can connect directly with international primes, systems integrators, and potential partners.From WDS’s perspective, it is about creating structured visibility and access, allowing conversations around capability, partnership models, and supply-chain integration to happen efficiently and transparently. The Zone facilitates supplier qualification discussions, joint venture exploration, and technology collaboration pathways that support the broader localization agenda.While the Show does not lead localization policy, it plays an important enabling role by bringing the ecosystem together in one place.Q7: Beyond exhibitions and demonstrations, how important are the leadership and content programs at WDS?They are critical. Defense today is as much about strategy, integration, and resilience as it is about hardware. The leadership discussions and content theaters provide context, helping participants understand how capabilities fit into wider operational, economic, and geopolitical realities.The programs address real-world challenges, including multi-domain integration, operational resilience, AI and autonomous systems, cyber defense, and the shift toward co-development and localization. They elevate the quality of engagement by enabling structured exchanges between policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators.Q8: Talent development has featured strongly at WDS this year. Why is that significant?Long-term capability depends on people. The Future Talent Program reflects a clear recognition that defense ecosystems are built not only on technology, but on skills, education, and human capital.By exposing Saudi students and young professionals to real industry environments — including engineering, advanced manufacturing, innovation, and emerging technologies — the Show supports workforce readiness and awareness, complementing national efforts to build a future-ready talent pipeline aligned with Vision 2030.Q9: From your vantage point, what does success look like for World Defense Show beyond headline announcements?Success is measured by continuity. It is not just about what is announced during the week, but about what continues afterward — partnerships that progress, discussions that deepen, and relationships that evolve into long-term collaboration.Previous editions of WDS facilitated multi-billion-riyal agreements and industrial partnerships, many of which have matured into operational programs, joint ventures, and technology collaborations. That continuity is the true measure of impact.Q10: Looking ahead, how do you see World Defense Show evolving over the coming editions?The evolution of the Show will continue to be guided by relevance rather than size alone. As defense technologies, supply chains, and partnership models evolve, WDS will continue adapting its programs, platforms, and structure to reflect those shifts.The objective remains consistent: to provide a serious, international platform that supports integration, industrial development, and long-term collaboration, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s ambitions and the needs of the global defense community.",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658775/business/world-defense-show-2026-reflects-maturity-scale-and-global-confidence-says-mansour-al-babtain,saudigazette_73,en,2010
2026-02-08,Jeeny and Al Rajhi Bank launch Saudi Arabia’s first fully integrated ride-hailing loyalty ecosystem,"Jeeny, the region’s leading smart mobility platform, announced on Sunday a strategic partnership with Al Rajhi Bank to integrate Mokafaa, Saudi Arabia’s leading loyalty program, directly into the Jeeny ride-hailing experience. The partnership marks a major step toward redefining everyday mobility by embedding rewards into daily transportation, turning daily rides into a smarter and more rewarding choice for customers across the Kingdom. By bringing together everyday mobility with one of Saudi Arabia’s strongest loyalty ecosystems, Jeeny and Al Rajhi Bank share a clear vision: delivering tangible, practical value that goes beyond convenience. The collaboration is designed to help users better manage transportation costs, save more over time, and benefit from rewards that naturally encourage continued usage, without changing how they move or pay. At the heart of the partnership is Saudi Arabia’s first fully integrated Earn & Burn loyalty experience within ride-hailing. By embedding Mokafaa directly into the ride journey, Jeeny becomes the first ride-hailing app in the Kingdom to enable users to seamlessly earn and redeem loyalty points within a single, end to end experience transforming daily commuting into a continuous source of value. As part of this integration, users earn 4 Mokafaa points for every SR1 spent on Jeeny rides, regardless of payment method. Points are earned automatically through everyday commuting, allowing customers to unlock value from mobility they already rely on, helping them better manage transportation costs over time. Accumulated Mokafaa points can be redeemed to top up the Jeeny Wallet and pay for rides directly, helping lower future ride costs in a way that supports long-term affordability rather than one-off discounts. This approach reinforces sustainable savings and positions loyalty as an integral part of daily mobility. To support smooth adoption, the rollout is anchored in a user-centric education approach. Customers are guided step by step through linking their Mokafaa accounts, understanding how points are earned on each ride, and using rewards through the Jeeny app, ensuring clarity on how everyday rides contribute to future savings. As Jeeny continues to play an active role in Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation, this partnership reflects a shared commitment to building mobility solutions that are accessible, value-driven, and designed for long-term growth, contributing to a more connected, rewarding, and digitally enabled mobility ecosystem across the Kingdom.",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658766/business/jeeny-and-al-rajhi-bank-launch-saudi-arabias-first-fully-integrated-ride-hailing-loyalty-ecosystem,saudigazette_73,en,2010

2026-02-05,Saudia’s rebrand pays dividends as Riyadh Air enters market,"RIYADH — Saudia’s decision to rebrand three years ago is delivering strong commercial and reputational gains as the Kingdom’s aviation sector expands with the launch of Riyadh Air, the airline’s marketing chief said.Speaking at the Saudi Media Forum, Saudia Group Chief Marketing Officer Khalid Tash said the rebrand, launched three years ago, was designed to reposition the Kingdom’s flagship carrier for a new phase of growth, while reinforcing its national identity and long aviation heritage.“Three years ago, we decided to renew Saudia’s visual identity as the airline entered a new phase of development and transformation,” Tash said. “The goal was to evolve without losing who we are.”Rather than creating an entirely new brand, Saudia drew inspiration from its own history, particularly the 1970s, which Tash described as a golden era marked by creativity, strong service culture and forward-looking design.“The 1970s were ahead of their time,” he said. “There was a conscious decision to return to our roots while presenting them in a modern way.”Tash said the rebrand also helped clearly distinguish Saudia’s identity ahead of the launch of Riyadh Air, positioning each carrier with a different brand proposition.“A commercial brand creates emotions and associations,” he said. “We want Saudia to stand for authenticity and national pride. This is our niche.”He downplayed concerns about competition with Riyadh Air, describing the emergence of a second national airline as positive for the sector.“We do not see Riyadh Air as a competitor,” Tash said.“Competition in pricing and services is healthy and benefits the Kingdom. The objective is to connect Saudi Arabia to as many destinations as possible and attract more visitors.”Tash said the rebrand has produced measurable results, both commercially and in public perception.Saudia has recorded growth in sales and bookings over the past three years, alongside improvements in revenues and operational performance, he said, noting that the airline has benefited from wider economic growth across Saudi Arabia.The group tracks brand performance through two indicators: reputation score and brand value. According to Tash, Saudia’s reputation score has improved by about 31 percent over the past three years, reflecting both customer experience and public perception.More striking, he said, has been the growth in brand value.“Before the rebrand, Saudia’s brand value stood at $506 million,” Tash said. “Today it has reached $1.1 billion, more than doubling in three years.”Tash said branding decisions at Saudia carry a broader responsibility beyond commercial considerations.“We represent a country,” he said. “Every detail must rise to the level of representing Saudi Arabia itself.”",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658701/business/saudia-brand-value-jumps-to-11bn-after-rebrand-tash-says,saudigazette_73,en,2010

2026-01-28,SentinelOne deepens its commitment to Saudi Arabia’s digital future,"SentineOne plays a major role in bolstering the Kingdom's digital economy and cybersecurity journey by having a strong local presence, advanced AI-native technology, and supporting local talent.Meriam ElOuazzani, Regional Senior Director for the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa at SentinelOne, says the company’s vision for Saudi Arabia is built around a long-term partnership. “We want to be a trusted, committed cybersecurity partner who supports Saudi organizations with autonomous, scalable, and sovereign security capabilities as they are on their digital transformation journey.”A major part of that strategy is the establishment of SentinelOne’s Regional Headquarters in Riyadh and the expansion of local teams dedicated to customer success, technical expertise, and partner enablement. ElOuazzani explains that this foundation ensures stronger engagement across government, large enterprises, and critical sectors that rely on fast, reliable, and locally attuned support.Another step is making SentinelOne’s Singularity Platform accessible locally on Google Cloud in the Kingdom. By hosting it internally, the company enables organizations to experience the latest AI-driven security while ensuring their data remains sovereign and compliant with national regulations. “Local hosting allows Saudi organizations to benefit from autonomous, real-time protection while keeping sensitive data entirely within the country and having full control over it,” she says. “It reflects our commitment to strengthening cyber resilience and digital trust across the KSA.”This commitment supports the Saudi Vision 2030 objectives, such as innovation, cloud adoption, AI integration, and safe digital expansion across public and private sectors. ElOuazzani notes that SentinelOne’s role in the Kingdom goes beyond providing technology. “We see ourselves as a strategic partner and enabler to Saudi Arabia. We aim to guide digital transformation safely with in-country infrastructure, strong local expertise, and AI-centered protection that gives organizations the confidence to innovate rapidly.” As security capabilities evolve and advance with AI, so does the threat landscape. Enterprises in the region are facing a lot of complex ransomware operations, cloud misconfigurations, and identity attacks. “Attackers are moving faster than ever,” ElOuazzani says.“They are threatening endpoints, cloud workloads, and identity pathways with a level of sophistication that calls for equally smart, autonomous defense.”SentinelOne‘s AI-native Singularity Platform is the answer to all these challenges as it constantly analyzes actions across endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and data attacks as and when they occur. Autonomous agents detect abnormalities in real-time, block ransomware and zero-day vulnerabilities before they cause harm. It also remediates without waiting for human intervention. Enhanced capabilities such as Purple AI and AI-SIEM give security teams deeper visibility and faster investigation paths. This empowers them to take action immediately at machine speed. With local hosting on Google Cloud, this protection comes along with the performance, residency, and compliance required by national regulations.Looking ahead, AI will shape the future of cybersecurity in numerous ways. ElOuazzani believes that security will shift from just being supportive to being more involved in orchestrating intelligently.“We are moving towards a future of autonomous SOCs where AI can reason, prioritize, and coordinate response across the entire environment,” she says. “It is essential for keeping pace with attackers that are already using AI to scale attacks.”ElOuazzani puts forward that these developments solidify the importance of unified, autonomous platforms that can operate at scale while providing organizations the visibility and control they need.SentinelOne’s continued investment in infrastructure, talent development, and advanced AI-powered protection shows how committed the company is to the Kingdom’s long-term digital goals. “Saudi Arabia is setting global benchmarks for digital transformation,” ElOuazzani says.“And we are proud to support that journey with sovereign, autonomous, and future-ready cybersecurity.”",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658521/business/sentinelone-deepens-its-commitment-to-saudi-arabias-digital-future,saudigazette_73,en,2010

2026-01-28,"iCAUR V27 Saudi Media Test Drive ignites excitement, conquering the Edge of the World!","On January 22, iCAUR held a V27 media test drive event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Twelve local journalists and KOLs took four V27s to the famous natural landmark, the Edge of the World. They got a hands-on experience of the Boxy Styled SUV’s classic style and advanced technology on challenging real-world roads. In the morning, journalists and KOLs gathered at Riyadh downtown. Through product briefings and interactive sessions, guests got an up-close look at the V27’s core technologies and design philosophy while enjoying a relaxed brunch introducing iCAUR in detail. Afterwards, the test drive convoy left the city and drove roughly 200km northwest to the Edge of the World. During the drive, participants praised the V27’s smooth and quiet ride. They also praised the 15.4-inch 3K HD touchscreen and the smart infotainment system powered by the 8155 chip. Voice control for navigation, climate, and music was also highly appreciated. The test drive destination, the Edge of the World, is located north of the Tuwaiq Mountains, which stretches up to 1,000 km. It is a steep cliff with a drop of about 300 meters and is one of Saudi Arabia’s most iconic natural wonders. The nearly two-hour journey passes vast plains with almost no signal and few clear road signs. The desert is full of faint tire tracks and gullies eroded by rain. In this environment, the V27’s power and off-road capability are fully showcased. As iCAUR’s first mass-production model equipped with Golden REEV (Range-Extended Electric Vehicle), the V27 uses a 1.5T engine dedicated to range extension, with a thermal efficiency of 45.79% and the ability to generate 3.71kWh per liter of fuel.

2026-01-28,Redefining telecom and media industries transformation: leveraging intelligent choice architectures,"By Sujatha Gopal, CTO, Communications, Media and Information Services, TCS In today’s hyper-connected world, transformation in telecom and media is no longer a milestone—it’s a continuous journey. As networks evolve toward autonomy and operations become increasingly agentic, Intelligent Choice Architectures (ICAs) are emerging as a strategic part of this shift. ICAs are human-centric AI systems that integrate behavioral economics, experiential intelligence, and real-time personalization to guide decision-making. Leading enterprises are adopting ICAs to orchestrate intelligent decision-making across the value chain—blending human-centric AI, behavioral economics, experiential intelligence, and real-time personalization.Dynamic systems that combine human intelligence with agentic, generative, and predictive AI, ICAs go beyond automation to reshape how humans and machines collaborate across the value chain. Decision-making shifts from reactive to enterprise-wide orchestration, enabling smarter, faster, and context-aware decisions. Enterprises become perpetually adaptive, with the ability to continuously learn, evolve, and respond to challenges and opportunities with confidence and precision.This shift gives telcos and media companies new opportunities to guide customer decisions, optimize operations, and build trust across digital touchpoints. Global Momentum: From Automation to AdaptationAcross North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, telecom and media leaders are deploying Agentic AI to manage operations with minimal human intervention. These autonomous and semi-autonomous agents enable networks and platforms to self-heal, dynamically allocate resources, and respond to anomalies in real time. Building on agentic AI’s inherent ability to operate across domains, synthesize data, and coordinate complex workflows, ICAsembed intelligence into every layer—from core infrastructure to edge services and content delivery networks.As softwarized networks and cloud-native media platforms increasingly enable intent-based service delivery, embedded experiential intelligence allows systems to learn from user behavior and performance data. This continuous learning empowers providers to deliver seamless, personalized services—whether optimizing latency for gamers, tailoring content for viewers, or adjusting bandwidth for remote workers. Scaling AI ResponsiblyGlobal telecom and media giants are leveraging vast operational datasets to train domain-specific AI models. These models support predictive maintenance, intelligent provisioning, content curation, and customer support automation. Scaling these models without compromising accuracy or agility requires a robust framework for how knowledge, authority, and responsibility flow across systems. ICAs help root trust not merely in outcome accuracy but also intransparency and validation through protocols for continual intervention, escalation, and consensus among humans and machines In regions with stringent data governance, ICAs help reinforce sovereign AI infrastructures that embed transparency, ethical principles, and customer trust at the core.  Strategic Relevance in the Middle EastIn the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, ICAs are emerging as key enablers of national digital transformation agendas. As part of Saudi Vision 2030, telecom and media modernization is a central pillar, driven by goals around smart cities, digital infrastructure, and data sovereignty.As cities become smarter, telcos must evolve from service providers to strategic partners in urban innovation. ICAs will be instrumental in this shift by:* Enabling adaptive intelligence for urban infrastructure.* Supporting sovereign AI systems that respect local data governance.* * Reinforcing national visions like Saudi Vision 2030, where telco modernization is central to digital transformation.Real-world examples illustrate how ICAs are already shaping customer journeys:* In the UAE, a leading telecom provider uses real-time feedback to trigger instant solutions, reducing friction and building trust.* An Arabic streaming platform applies AI to recommend shows and auto-play content, simplifying user choices and enhancing engagement.These examples reflect how ICAs can reduce effort, guide decisions, and personalize engagement, turning every interaction into a strategic moment. ICA in ActionPowered by NVIDIA, TCS AI Native Telco offerings enable custom models trained on enterprise data, driving real-time network optimization, predictive maintenance, and autonomous operations. ICAs embedded into telecom infrastructure deliver adaptive, resilient, and customer-centric services.Building on this, TCS is helping telcos establish Sovereign AI Factories, AI-driven digital infrastructure platforms designed to serve national and enterprise needs. These factories enable telcos to offer B2B AI solutions to public sector entities, enterprises, and startups. In the Middle East, where data sovereignty, national AI strategies, and localized innovation are top priorities, this model is especially relevant.Beyond telecom, ICAs are transforming media engagement - curating content bundles, personalizing trailers, and optimizing release schedules based on behavioral and cultural signals. For example, Arabic-first personalization and rights-aware scheduling ensure relevance and compliance in regional markets, guiding viewers toward meaningful choices.The Way AheadAs telecom and media enterprises navigate the next wave of digital transformation, ICAs will be pivotal in shaping future-ready organizations. They are not just technological enablers. They are strategic instruments harmonizing human judgment and machine intelligence to deliver purpose-driven outcomes.Key Imperatives* Invest in scalable ICA frameworks built on a foundation of trust, transparency, and ethics .* Foster cross-functional collaboration between data scientists, behavioral economists, and experience designers.* * Align ICA initiatives with national visions—such as Saudi Vision 2030—to ensure innovation is impactful, inclusive, and sustainable.The future of telecom and media will be defined by those who can orchestrate intelligence across the value chain—seamlessly and strategically. ICAs are the compass guiding this journey. Sujatha Gopal is the chief technology officer of TCS’ Communications, Media, and Information Services business. With over 25 years of work experience across various industries including telecommunications, banking and financial services, manufacturing, retail, and media, Sujatha is a veteran industry advisor to several CXOs.",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658497/business/redefining-telecom-and-media-industries-transformation-leveraging-intelligent-choice-architectures,saudigazette_73,en,2010

2026-01-26,"Gold tops $5,000 for first time as concerns over US policies drive historic rally","LONDON — Gold prices surged beyond $5,000 per ounce for the first time ever, extending a historic rally that saw the precious metal jump by more than 60% in 2025.Investors rushed to the safe-haven asset as tensions between the US and key allies in Europe over Greenland have added to growing concerns about financial and geopolitical uncertainty.The historic 2026 rally has been driven by a series of market-destabilizing global and domestic moves by US President Donald, from tariff threats against NATO allies, the military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and the criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.On Saturday he threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.Demand has also been driven by a weaker US dollar, higher-than-expected inflation, and predictions the Fed will further cut interest rates this year.Demand for precious metals has also been driven by a range of other factors including higher-than-usual inflation, the weak US dollar, buying by central banks around the world and as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this year.On Friday, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, building on its almost 150% rise last year.Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Washington seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have also helped push up the price of gold.One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tons of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association.""When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,"" said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery.""It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world,"" he added.Gold saw a blockbuster year in 2025, with its biggest annual gain since 1979 as investors flocked to precious metals.With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are overpriced, gold repeatedly hit new record highs.""I think a large part of that is the extreme uncertainty we have around US policy,"" said Nikos Kavlis from research consultancy Metals Focus.While economic concerns can help to push up the price of gold, it also tends to rise when investors expect interest rates to be cut.Lower rates typically mean smaller returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to assets like gold and silver.The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its main interest rate twice this year.""It's inversely correlated because the opportunity cost of keeping the money in a [government bond] is really not worth it anymore, so people go to gold,"" said Ahmad Assiri, Research Strategist at Pepperstone.It's not just investors who have been buying up gold.Last year, central banks added hundreds of tons of bullion to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council.""There's a very clear shift away from the US dollar, which is benefiting gold immensely,"" said Kavalis.The start of this year has seen gold continue to rally but Frappell warns the ""news-driven"" market could also result in a fall in its price.""There's got to be scope for unexpected news that actually might be positive for the world and not necessarily positive for gold,"" he said.But not everybody is buying gold for purely investment reasons.In many cultures, the metal is purchased during festivals or given as gifts at celebrations such as weddings.In India, the annual Diwali festival is believed to be an auspicious occasion to buy precious metals in order to bring on wealth and luck.According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).China is the world's largest single consumer market for gold, with many believing that buying it brings good fortune.""We often see a seasonal uptick in demand around Chinese New Year, which we are seeing at the moment to an extent,"" said Kavalis, referencing the upcoming Year of the Horse, which begins in February. — Agencies",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658444/business/gold-tops-5000-for-first-time-as-concerns-over-us-policies-drive-historic-rally,saudigazette_73,en,2010

2026-01-22,Bancara: The financial institution redefining what it means to live wealth,"In the rarest circles of global finance, reputations are not built through marketing or momentum. They are built through silence, precision, and an unwavering commitment to standards that most will never witness. Bancara belongs to this world. It has quietly positioned itself as the preferred institution for individuals and families who do not chase wealth but steward it.There is a growing sentiment among global investors, who have tasted every flavor of modern banking. They are tired of noisy platforms. They are tired of retail chaos. They are tired of institutions that confuse technology with sophistication. These individuals want something different. Something anchored. Something timeless. This is the space Bancara has claimed fully.A New club in global financeBancara’s rise is not a story of scale. It is a story of selection. The firm built its foundation on a simple internal belief: true wealth demands structure, consistency, and an environment crafted with purpose. With its recently obtained international banking license, Bancara has entered a category that only a few institutions ever reach. It now operates as a fully recognized financial entity serving regions across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East through regulated, compliant, and highly secure operations.Clients describe the experience as liberating. A single relationship that grants the freedom to trade, diversify, relocate, preserve, and plan their wealth across borders. Multi-currency banking, institutional trading access, concierge mobility, global accounts, compliance infrastructure, lifestyle support, and high-level advisory converge in one place. It feels less like a brokerage and more like a private financial universe designed around the world’s next generation of global elites.The culture of disciplineWhat separates Bancara from traditional financial firms is its culture. Everything is built around the idea of permanence. The firm does not chase quarterly hype. It does not chase aggressive positioning. It does not chase trends. It builds for decades. It opts for regulatory clarity over excessive marketing. It favors selective onboarding over open-door admissions.This discipline is reflected in every service. Segregated accounts. Precision execution. Conservative risk protocols. Client-first transparency. Deep compliance monitoring. Quiet but unshakeable operational governance. Bancara believes that wealth is not a game of chances but a craft, and crafts must be protected.Where wealth becomes a lifestyleFor many of Bancara’s clients, finance is only one part of the equation. Their lives move across continents. Their portfolios live in multiple currencies. Their needs evolve with every new jurisdiction they enter. Bancara created a concierge infrastructure that mirrors the way these individuals actually live. This is where the institution becomes something more than a financial partner.Private aviation arrangements. International relocation support. Golden visa guidance. Access to elite health networks. Estate coordination in multiple regions. Confidential travel planning. These services elevate Bancara from a financial entity to a lifestyle architecture that supports a global citizen with complex needs.It is rare to find a firm that treats wealth management as both a science and an art. Bancara has managed to blend the two effortlessly.Technology at the level of a private institutionBancara X, AutoBancara, MetaTrader 5 integration, institutional liquidity systems, and multi-asset execution environments are not presented as flashy features. They are presented as tools in a greater ecosystem. Clients do not need to choose between sophistication and simplicity. They are given both.The platforms feel refined. They feel quiet. They feel stable. They are not built to impress beginners. They are built to empower people, who already understand the language of capital.The rise of a modern financial iconBancara is becoming more than a financial institution. It is becoming a symbol. In a world where the lines between wealth and chaos are thinner than ever, this firm represents clarity. It represents composure. It represents the idea that the future of finance belongs to those who design intelligently and govern with restraint.There are financial brands that cater to the masses. There are trading platforms that chase attention. And then there is Bancara. A name spoken more in private dinners than on public boards. A structure trusted by individuals who have more to lose and even more to protect. A global ecosystem for people who want their wealth to feel as stable as stone and as fluid as opportunity.Clients do not join Bancara for features. They join for philosophy. They stay for certainty.Bancara is not simply rising. It is becoming inevitable.",https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/658364/business/bancara-the-financial-institution-redefining-what-it-means-to-live-wealth,saudigazette_73,en,2010

The new site brings together sales, after-sales services, and customer engagement into a single, seamless experience, strengthening long-term operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The launch was announced during a launch event hosted in Riyadh recently, attended by John Iossifidis, Group CEO of Al Ghurair, alongside senior executives from the company, Arabian Heritage Motors, and Chery International Group, as well as government stakeholders, media, and industry leaders. The milestone marks a key step in EXEED’s journey in the Kingdom and reflects rising demand for premium mobility offerings. The decision to base this expansion in Riyadh reflects the Kingdom’s accelerating mobility transformation and the role of Saudi Vision 2030 in attracting high-value industrial and technological investment. Operational readiness, strength of local partnerships, and sustained growth momentum made the capital the natural choice. Spanning 5,000 square meters, the flagship is designed to support the complete ownership journey, and a fully integrated on-site service center. The facility also has a training center able to deliver brand specific skills for technical and non-technical team members. In his opening remarks, John Iossifidis, Group CEO of Al Ghurair, said: “Saudi Arabia is central to how we see the region developing and where we want to build for the years ahead. This is a young, fast-evolving market with rising expectations, and customers will judge brands on consistency and after-sales support. We are approaching the Kingdom with a long-term mindset, investing in capability and standards from the outset. That is how you earn trust in demanding environments, and that is the benchmark we are setting in Riyadh.” Oscar Rivoli, CEO Motors, Al Ghurair Mobility, said: ""Our expansion into Saudi Arabia is driven by confidence in its role in shaping the region’s mobility landscape. With the largest passenger car market in the GCC, and a young population, where around 71% are under the age of 35, expectations around ownership and service are evolving quickly. Our approach draws on a long-standing legacy and partnership-led growth, with sustainability at its core. It was developed in the United Arab Emirates, and we are now bringing it into Saudi Arabia as a priority market. The aim is to deliver a premium experience supported by high-standard after-sales support and trust earned through consistent performance, enabled by the operational depth and infrastructure we have built over decades.” Kyle Chen, Country Director of EXEED, said: “Riyadh is a strategic choice for this flagship and reflects our confidence in Saudi Arabia’s investment environment. Saudi Vision 2030, particularly its focus on innovation and the advancement of industrial ecosystems, aligns closely with our measured, sustainable approach to expansion. As a premium brand under the Chery International Group, EXEED is built on a strong global foundation. In 2025 alone, the Group exported more than 1.3 million vehicles to over 120 countries and regions. The new site will support the next phase of our growth in Saudi Arabia, backed by local partnerships and a clear understanding of market needs.” EXEED is part of the wider Chery ecosystem, which has a broad international footprint and employs more than 80,000 professionals. The brand is present in 22 markets through 157 showrooms globally, with a portfolio of six models. In December 2024, Chery International opened a regional spare parts warehouse in Jebel Ali, Dubai, serving Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC. Spanning 12,000 square meters and holding 20,000+ readily available spare parts, the facility was built to reduce lead times and improve after-sales response for customers in the Kingdom.
